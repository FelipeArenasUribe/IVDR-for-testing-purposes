# IVDR-for-testing-purposes
This repo contains the testing data and a sample code used in the paper "Design and Validation of an In-Vehicle Data Recorder System for Testing Purposes".

Three files can be found.

The data obtained for the experimental part of the paper. It contains data of a light-duty vehicle performance inside a fixed route. This data was obtained by Julian Echeverry-Mejia, he is the intellectual owner of it.

Sample code used to extract the data. This code is a simpler version that can be used as a simpler version of the IVDR proposed in the article. The code can be used to extract performance data from light-duty vehicles that include an OBDII Diagnostic system.

Receiver code to run in a computer to receive data from the IVDR and store in a .csv file.
